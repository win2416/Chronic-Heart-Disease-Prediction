## Introduction
I build a CHD(Chronic Heart Disease) prediction model that can predict heart disease using Support Vector Machine, a machine learning method. 

At first, I have done some sort of data preprocessing and data analysis to understand the data correlation to each other and sort out some top features of the dataset for predicting the dependable variable, which is, in my case, **TenYearCHD**. After that, I used a total of four machine learning methods those are:
* Logistic Regression
* K-nearest Neighbour
* Decision Tree 
* Support Vector Machine

I used a support vector machine to make the final prediction model from those machine learning methods because it has the highest accuracy among the other methods. For a detailed analysis of data and comparing different machine learning approaches, I used Jupyter Notebook. The Jupyter notebook file is placed at the **"Jupyter Notebook File for Detailed Analysis"** directory. Model dumping done by this file: **Data Preprocessing and Model Dumping** and Prediction done through this file: **CHD prediction using dumped SVM model**
